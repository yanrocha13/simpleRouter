# simple-router demo project

## Notes

This project is here to give you a basic understanding of how to setup and using simple-php-router.

You can find the documentation for simple-php-router here:
https://github.com/skipperbent/simple-php-router

Please note that this demo-project only covers how to integrate the `simple-router` in a project without a framework. If you are using some sort of PHP framework in your project the implementation might vary.

**What we won't cover:**

- How to setup a solution that fits your need. This is a basic demo to help you get started.
- Understanding of MVC; including Controllers, Middlewares or ExceptionHandlers.
- How to integrate into third party frameworks.

**What we cover:**

- How to get up and running fast - from scratch.
- How to get ExceptionHandlers, Middlewares and Controllers working.
- How to setup your webservers.

## Installation

- Navigate to the `demo-project` folder in terminal and run `composer update` to install the latest version.
- Point your webserver to `demo-project/public`.

### Setting up Nginx

If you are using Nginx please make sure that url-rewriting is enabled.

You can easily enable url-rewriting by adding the following configuration for the Nginx configuration-file for the demo-project.

```
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}
```

### Setting up Apache

Nothing special is required for Apache to work. We've include the `.htaccess` file in the `public` folder. If rewriting is not working for you, please check that the `mod_rewrite` module (htaccess support) is enabled in the Apache configuration.

## Folder structure

| Folder        | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| routes         |Folder contains the files with our custom routes.|
| app            |Contains projects-specific PHP classes.|
| public         |Public folder which are accessible through the web.|

## Notes

The demo project has it's own `Router` class implementation which extends the `SimpleRouter` class with further functionality.
This class can be useful adding additional functionality that are required before and after routing occurs or any extra functionality belonging to the router itself.

In this project we also use our custom router-class to autoload the `routes.php` file from our custom location (`app/routes.php`).

Please check the `routes.php` file in `demo-project/app` for all the urls/rules available in the project.

### CSRF-verifier

For the purpose of this demo, we've added a custom CSRF-verifier middleware called `CsrfVerifier` and disabled CSRF checks for all calls to `/api/*`. This will ensure that CSRF form-checks are not applied when calling our demo api url.

### Exception handlers

The included `CustomExceptionHandler` class returns a very basic json response for errors received on calls to `/api/*` or otherwise just a simple formatted error response.

### Middlewares

`ApiVerification` class is added to all calls to `/api/*`. This simple class just adds some data to the `Request` object, which is returned in one of the methods in the `ApiController` class. We've added this class to demonstrate that you can use middlewares to ensure that the user has the correct authentication - before router loads the controller itself.

### Urls

Please see `routes.php` for all routes and rules.

| URL        |
| ------------- |
| /             |
| /api/demo       |
| /companies       |
| /companies/[id]  |
| /contact         |
